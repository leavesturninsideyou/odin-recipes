This current project is a recipe website. It will have a main index page and links to several recipes.
The skills that will be demonstrated on its completion will be the following: 

Links (anchor element <a>)
Attributes(href and src)
Headers(<h1> and so on)
Paragraphs (<p>)
Bold/Italics (<strong>, <em>)
Lists (<ul>, <ol>, and <li>.)

This will also be my first project using HTML.
